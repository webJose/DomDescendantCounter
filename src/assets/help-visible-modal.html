        <p>An element is counted as <strong>visible</strong> if it meets all of the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Display:</strong> The element's computed style <code>display</code> is not <code>none</code></li>
            <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> The element's computed style <code>visibility</code> is <code>visible</code></li>
            <li><strong>Opacity:</strong> The element's computed style <code>opacity</code> is not <code>0</code></li>
            <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> The element has non-zero width and height (via <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code>)</li>
            <li><strong>Viewport intersection:</strong> The element's bounding rectangle intersects with the current viewport</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Elements that are positioned completely off-screen or outside the viewport will NOT be counted as visible, even if they meet the other criteria.</p>
        <p>This definition helps distinguish between elements that are actually rendered and visible to users versus those that are hidden through CSS or positioned outside the visible area.</p>
